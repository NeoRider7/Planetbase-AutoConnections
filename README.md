# Planetbase-AutoConnections
An update of JPFarias's AutoConnections mod 
[Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/planetbase/mods/9)
[Source](https://bitbucket.org/joaofarias/planetbase-modding/src/master/AutoConnections/)
, modified to use Harmony instead of Redirector. It relies on my own file (Modhooker) to ensure that the game's databases are
reloaded correctly and for some logging actions, but this is not really needed and the dependency can be coded out if desired.

At the moment, it is designed for use with the original version of [Planetbase Mod Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/planetbase/mods/1)
but I may (read: probably will) update it for the newer version found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/planetbase/mods/35).
